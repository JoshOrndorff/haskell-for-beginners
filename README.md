Haskell for Beginners
=====================
This is a collection of homework problems created to teach the Haskell for Beginners class at The Hacklab @ North Boynton.
The problems follow the text for the class, [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/),
chapter by chapter. Each problem file has problems intended to exercise the knowledge learned in just one section heading
of the chapter that it is in.

In addition there is a small midterm project to be completed after Chapter 8. There will be a final project as well.
