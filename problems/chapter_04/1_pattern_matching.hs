-- Write a function that implements Fizz Buzz
-- (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)
-- up to the number 15 with simple pattern matching.
-- After 15, give up and lose the game.
fizzBuzzLose :: Integer -> String
fizzBuzzLose = undefined

flipAll :: [(a,b)] -> [(b,a)]
flipAll = undefined

-- Write a function that moves the first element of a list to the end.


-- Write your own implementation of reverse to reverse a list
--   (your function will probably need to call itself)


-- Write a function to tell if a list's length is > 4.
-- Use only pattern matching to get the answer.


-- Write a function that pairs up each member of a list with
-- the one after it. For the list [1,2,3] the function should
-- return the list [(1,2),(2,3)]. (@ can help you here)
