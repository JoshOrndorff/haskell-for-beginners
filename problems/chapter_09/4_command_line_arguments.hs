-- Implement a program that processes input based on a command
-- specified as an argument on the command line. The mirror
-- command should reverse each line in the input. The reverseLines
-- command should reverse the order of lines in the input, without
-- changing the lines themselves.
--
-- If a second argument is given, it should be used as a filename
-- to read input from. Otherwise input should be read from stdin.
--
-- Btw, stdin :: Handle in System.IO ;)
