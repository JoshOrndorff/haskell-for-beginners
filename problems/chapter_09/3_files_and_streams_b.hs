-- Define a function that accepts a filename
-- and returns an action that will read the file
-- and print out each line reversed. Use `openFile`
-- to accomplish this.
--
-- You can use "samples/mirror.txt" to test your action.


-- Define another function like the one above, but
-- use `withFile`
--


-- Define yet another function like the one above, but
-- use `readFile`
--


-- Define a function that accepts *2* filenames and
-- returns an action that will read the contents of the
-- first file, reverse each line, and write it to the second
-- file
--
