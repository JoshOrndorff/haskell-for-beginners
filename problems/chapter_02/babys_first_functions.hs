-- define a function named avg that calculates the
-- average of two numbers
avg x y = undefined

-- use the avg function to calculate two different
-- "averages" of the numbers 2, 3 and 4.
--   The "averages" are 2.75 and 3.25
avg1 = undefined
avg2 = undefined

-- recalculate the two numbers above using infix notation
avg1_infix = undefined
avg2_infix = undefined

-- define a function that returns a boolean indicating
-- whether or not an interger is a multiple of 5 *or* 3
--   hint: 6 `mod` 3 is 0
--         6 `mod` 5 is 1


-- define a function that returns a boolean indicating
-- whether or not a interger is a *not* multiple of 5 *and* 3


-- define a function that works just like the last one
-- but uses a different boolean logic operator
-- (or instead of and, or vice-versa)


-- BONUS: define a function that works just like the
-- last one but uses *NO* boolean logic operators at all

-- define a function that checks to make sure the
-- two (or three) functions above give the same answer for a
-- provided number. It should return a string indicating
-- to the user whether or not the functions matched
