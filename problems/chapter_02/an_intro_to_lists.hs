-- Write a function that totals top 3 numbers in a
-- list (assuming the list is sorted with highest first)

-- Write a function to extract a portion of a string
-- based on position and length

-- Write a function to tell if a list's length is > 4
-- (it should return a boolean)

-- Write a function like the one above *without* referring
-- to the list's length

-- Write safe versions of tail and init that return
-- empty list if the list is empty

-- Write safe versions of head and last that take a
-- default value to return if the list is empty

-- write a function to tell if either the sum or product
-- of a list is in another list

-- write a function that reverses a section of a string
-- based on position and length. Use your substring function
-- from earlier to help.
