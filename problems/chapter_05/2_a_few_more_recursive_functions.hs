-- Define a function to remove all the elements of
-- one list from another. Given the lists [1,2,3]
-- and [5,6,1,7,2,8] it should return [5,6,7,8]


-- Define a function to perform the union of two
-- lists. Any elements from the second list that
-- are already in the first should not be duplicated
-- Given the lists [1,2,3]
-- and [5,6,1,7,2,8,5] it should return [1,2,3,5,6,7,8]


-- Define zip3', a function that takes three lists an
-- zips them into triples, stopping at the end of the
-- shortest list.


-- Define a function to count the occurrences of
-- a given element in a list
--  (Hint: you may need a helper function to do the recursion)
